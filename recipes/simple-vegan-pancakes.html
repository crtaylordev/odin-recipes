    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best vegan pancake recipe we know, but their fluffiness level does seem to fluctuate depend on our stovetop's mood / the wind / the position of the planets. Even a less-fluffy batch is delicious, though! Yields about 3 servings.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients</ul>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 cup</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> baking powder</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> granulated sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> non-dairy milk of choice</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> water</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> canola oil</li>
    <ol>Steps</ol>
        <li>Whisk dry ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients and stir with a large spoon until just combined. Some lumps are expected so do not over-mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy!.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease with vegan butter.</li>
        <li>Drop batter on to griddle/pan and cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.</li>
        <li>Stack 'em and serve 'em!</li>
